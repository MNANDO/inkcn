# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **shadcn UI component registry** - a collection of reusable React components that can be installed by others using `npx shadcn add <url>`. The project also includes a Next.js app for showcasing the components.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start development server at localhost:3000
pnpm build            # Build Next.js for production
pnpm lint             # Run ESLint
pnpm registry:sync    # Sync local components to registry/
pnpm registry:build   # Build registry components to public/r/
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Develop locally first** - Create and edit components in the project directories (e.g., `components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`) just as if they were installed from the registry. Import them using the same `@/` path aliases a consumer would use.
2. **Define in registry.json** - Every registry file must have a corresponding entry in `registry.json` with its metadata, dependencies, and file paths.
3. **Sync to registry** - Run `pnpm registry:sync` to copy the local components into `registry/new-york/`.
4. **Build the registry** - Run `pnpm registry:build` to generate the public registry output in `public/r/`.

## Architecture

### Registry System

- **[registry.json](registry.json)** - Defines all registry items with their metadata, dependencies, and file paths. All registry files must be defined here.
- **[registry/](registry/)** - Source components organized by style (currently `new-york`). Synced from local project files via `pnpm registry:sync`.
- **[public/r/](public/r/)** - Built registry output (generated by `pnpm registry:build`), served at `/r/`

### App Structure

- **[app/](app/)** - Next.js App Router pages (for showcasing components)
- **[components/](components/)** - Components used in the Next.js app itself
- **[components/ui/](components/ui/)** - shadcn UI base components
- **[lib/utils.ts](lib/utils.ts)** - Utility functions including `cn()` for Tailwind class merging

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 with App Router and React Server Components
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS v4
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- shadcn/ui (new-york style)
- pnpm package manager

## Path Aliases

`@/*` maps to the project root (e.g., `@/components`, `@/lib/utils`)

## Code Style

- **No `any` types** - Always use proper TypeScript types; avoid `any`
- **Only use shadcn components** - Do not install or use other UI component libraries; build all UI using shadcn/ui components
